# DevDiary

DevDiary is a website that is meant to track my development work on personal projects. I can post updates and blogs, and the website has a calendar similar to the github heatmap, that tracks days of work, and days without. 
It is built in Flask, using Bootstrap, and hosted on heroku.

It also has a CLI that can be used to update the blog - devdiary.py

The website is live at https://devdiary-samhattangady.herokuapp.com/
